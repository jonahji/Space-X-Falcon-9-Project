# Space-X-Falcon-9-Project

Our task: To develop a machine learning model for Space Y who wants to bid against SpaceX

The goal of model is to predict when Stage 1 will successfully land to save ~$100 million USD
Used data from a public SpaceX API and web scraping SpaceX Wikipedia page
Created data labels and stored data into a DB2 SQL database
Created a dashboard for visualization
Created a machine learning model with an accuracy of 83%

Allon Mask of SpaceY can use this model to predict with relatively high accuracy whether a launch will have a successful Stage 1 landing before launch to determine whether the launch should be made or not
